- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nPSert
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Astroberry on Raspberry Pi 4
- ðŸŒ± Current issue is, I would like to create a dual boot microSD card so that I can choose between straight Raspberry OS and Astroberry server.  Is this possible?  I've done this on a Windows PC with LILO, but don't know  how to do it on a Raspberry Pi.  If it's not possible, that would  be useful information.
